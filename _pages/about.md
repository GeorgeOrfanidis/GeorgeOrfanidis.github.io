I am Computer Science Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Florida Atlantic University and a research assistant at the [FAU Center for Connected Autonomy and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.fau.edu/engineering/research/c2a2/). I am expected to graduate in May 2026.

My research interests extend to the broad spectrum of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and signal processing, conducting research for distributed joint team training and operation of wirelessly connected AI agents, with an emphasis on single-sample space and time series inference in non-stationary environments (ground, air, and space).
