  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  title={Time-series analysis with small and faulty data: L1-norm decompositions of Hankel matrices},
  author={Orfanidis, Georgios I and Pados, Dimitris A and Sklivanitis, George},
  abstract={In the rapidly advancing field of autonomous systems, real-time operation and monitoring in non-stationary environments frequently relies on analysis (filtering/prediction) of short sequences of sensed data that may be partly unreliable, missing, or faulty. Hankel-matrix representation and decomposition is a model-free approach that is becoming increasingly popular for the analysis of time-series data taking advantage of the progress in linear algebra methods in past years. In this work, we establish that novel L1-norm decompositions of Hankel matrices offer sturdy resistance against partially faulty sensed sequences and, therefore, creates a strong new framework for robust real-time monitoring of autonomous systems. The findings in this paper are illustrated and supported by extensive experimentation on artificial data.},
